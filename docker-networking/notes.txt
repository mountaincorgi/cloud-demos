Network driver types

* bridge: default. Used when applications in standalone containers need to communicate running on the same host

* host: use the Docker host's networking directly

* overlay: connect multiple Docker daemons together, that may exist on different hosts. Swarm device --- standalone container, or 2 containers on different daemons

* none: disable all networking

* ipvlan/macvlan: gives you complete control over ipv4 / ipv6 addressing. Can be used when you need containers to LOOK like physical hosts on your network, with a unique MAC address

A container automatically receives an IP address for each network it is added to
The Docker serves as the DCHP server dynamically assigning IPs

Proxy servers (explore later)


#
docker network ls
docker network connect --ip / --ip6 (assign IPs)

docker run --dns 
Set one or more DNS serve addresses. Default to Google 8.8.8.8 for internet access

docker run --hostname
Set the hostname the container uses for itself. Defaults to the container ID
