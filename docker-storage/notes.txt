Volumes are overall more useful in persisting data, completely managed by Docker and you can use the Docker CLI to manage your volumes. No permission issues.

Volumes don't need to be associated with a particular container

Volumes have better performance vs bind-mounts on Mac and Windows

Volume drivers can be changed to point to the cloud rather than on the host

Bind mounts are dependent on a file system existing on the host machine, so not flexible. Plus bind mounts can be a security risk as it's directly linked to the host file system so you have to be careful

Bind mounts are useful for development environments, like devcontainers, where you can update code inside your container without needing to rebuild the image to run things

Also they are useful when you need Docker and other services to access the same directory on the host machine (not really sure when you'd need this)


# You're encouraged to use "--mount" because it's more explicit


docker volume create
docker volume ls
docker volume rm
docker container stop
docker container start
...

docker build -t docker-storages-demo .

docker run \
    --mount type=bind,src=/Users/zhongfu/projects/demos/docker-storage/myapp2,dst=/myapp2 \
    --mount type=volume,src=dstorages-demo-data,dst=/databases \
    --name dstorages-demo \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    docker-storages-demo


# Testing
* Try making a new endpoint and re-running the container
